# MEAL CALCULATOR APP
# This program calculates the total cost of a meal, including drinks, sales tax, and tips.
# It asks the user for the price of a child's meal, an adult's meal, drinks, and the number of children and adults.
# Then, it calculates the subtotal, adds sales tax and tips, and finally, calculates the change after payment.


# Collect data
price_child = float(input("What is the price of a child's meal? "))
price_adult = float(input("What is the price of an adult's meal? "))
price_drink = float(input("What is the price of a drink? "))
num_children = int(input("How many children are there? "))
num_adults = int(input("How many adults are there? "))

# Subtotal (cost of food and drinks)
subtotal = (price_child * num_children) + (price_adult * num_adults) + (price_drink * (num_children + num_adults))
print(f"Subtotal: ${subtotal:.2f}")

# Input and calculate sales tax
tax_rate = float(input("What is the sales tax rate? "))
sales_tax = subtotal * (tax_rate / 100)
total = subtotal + sales_tax
print(f"Sales Tax: ${sales_tax:.2f}")
print(f"Total (before tips): ${total:.2f}")

# Input and calculate tips
tip_percent = float(input("What percent would you like to tip? "))
tip_amount = total * (tip_percent / 100)
total_with_tips = total + tip_amount
print(f"Tip: ${tip_amount:.2f}")
print(f"Total with tips: ${total_with_tips:.2f}")

# Calculate change
payment = float(input("What is the payment amount? "))
change = payment - total_with_tips
print(f"Change: ${change:.2f}")
