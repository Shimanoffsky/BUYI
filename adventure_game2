# Adventure Game: Forest Adventure
# (hope you enjoy!)
# This game has 3 levels of choices, and each decision affects the storyline.
# Added creativity: There are hidden choices and extra levels of detail, like an enchanted map
# that guides the player, increasing the immersion.
# Description: I added hidden paths and more than two choices in key parts of the game.
# I also included input handling for invalid responses.
